# TestPlatform

## Welcome to the  project!

This application is being developed as a Spring Boot internship project, in which we'll be diving into several components of the Spring family.

The idea of the application is simple, it's a test platform application in which admin and examiners can create and publish tests. Examinees can then take those tests. To make the application a bit more interesting, it also includes a user management module with functionality such as email sign up and login. It then uses Spring Security and Spring AOP for authentication and authorization purposes. Admin and Examiners are required to open an account in order to create and edit their own tests, but they can take quizzes without the need for an account.

The application includes a simple but functional web frontend using React and Bootstrap, but this repository only includes **backend Spring Boot code**.
